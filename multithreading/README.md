# Lab \#2 - Multithreading 
In this section you will find the demo code used to introduce pthreads, as well as, classroom exercises

## Compiling the code
You will need to have `gcc` and `make` installed on your system. 
- On linux installing the `build-essential` package will provide these tools (`sudo apt install -y build-essential`). 
- On mac you will need to install Xcode from the app store, and afterwards install compiler tools with `code-select --install`
